"# Bone-Break-Classification-with-computer-Vision" 
# Bone Break Classification Project

## Overview

This project involves a deep learning model designed to classify bone fractures based on input images. The application provides a web interface where users can upload images of bone fractures, and the model predicts the type of fracture. Additionally, it displays detailed information about the predicted fracture type, including an overview, symptoms, causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Predicts the type of bone fracture from an input image.
- **Detailed Information**: Provides comprehensive information about each type of fracture.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface to upload images and view results.

Detailed Fracture Information
Avulsion Fracture
Overview: An avulsion fracture is where a small piece of bone attached to a tendon or ligament gets pulled away from the main part of the bone. This often happens when you suddenly change direction.
Symptoms: Sudden, severe pain, Bruising, Swelling, Muscle pain, Popping or cracking sound, Difficulty moving the limb
Causes: Suddenly changing direction, Sprinting, Kicking, Leaping, Falling on an outstretched hand
Diagnosis: X-rays to look at bones and joints, CT scan for a more precise view
Treatment: Immobilization in a cast or splint, Anti-inflammatory medications, Restriction of activity, Icing the area, Physical therapy
Prognosis: Recovery typically takes about three to 12 weeks. You may need to follow up with an orthopaedist.
Comminuted Fracture
Overview: A comminuted fracture is when the bone breaks into three or more pieces. It often results from high-impact trauma.
Symptoms: Severe pain, Swelling, Bruising, Deformity of the affected area, Inability to move the limb
Causes: High-impact trauma such as car accidents, Falls from a significant height, Sports injuries
Diagnosis: X-rays to determine the extent of the fracture, CT scan for detailed imaging
Treatment: Surgery to realign and stabilize the bone, Physical therapy for rehabilitation, Pain management
Prognosis: Recovery may take several months, and physical therapy is usually required for full recovery.
Fracture Dislocation
Overview: A fracture dislocation occurs when a bone is broken and displaced from its normal position in the joint.
Symptoms: Severe pain, Swelling, Deformity at the joint, Inability to move the affected joint
Causes: Trauma or injury to the joint, Sports activities, Falls
Diagnosis: X-rays to assess the fracture and joint displacement, MRI for detailed imaging
Treatment: Reduction of the dislocated joint, Immobilization with a cast or splint, Pain management, Physical therapy
Prognosis: Recovery depends on the severity of the injury and may require several weeks of rehabilitation.
Greenstick Fracture
Overview: A greenstick fracture is an incomplete fracture where the bone bends. It typically occurs in children whose bones are softer and more flexible.
Symptoms: Pain at the site of injury, Swelling, Deformity or bending of the limb
Causes: Falling on an outstretched arm, Direct blow to the bone
Diagnosis: Physical examination, X-rays to confirm the fracture
Treatment: Casting or splinting, Follow-up X-rays to ensure proper healing
Prognosis: Greenstick fractures usually heal well with immobilization in 4 to 6 weeks.
Hairline Fracture
Overview: A hairline fracture is a small crack in the bone, often resulting from repetitive stress or minor trauma.
Symptoms: Pain that worsens with activity, Swelling, Tenderness at the fracture site
Causes: Repetitive stress or overuse, Sudden increase in activity
Diagnosis: X-rays may not show early fractures, MRI or bone scan for detailed imaging
Treatment: Rest and avoiding activities that cause pain, Protective footwear or brace
Prognosis: Most hairline fractures heal with rest over 6 to 8 weeks.
Impaired Fracture
Overview: An impacted fracture occurs when one bone fragment is driven into another bone fragment, often due to high-impact trauma.
Symptoms: Severe pain, Swelling, Deformity of the affected area
Causes: High-impact trauma, Sports injuries, Falls
Diagnosis: X-rays to assess the fracture, CT scan for detailed imaging
Treatment: Realignment of the bone fragments, Immobilization with a cast or splint, Pain management
Prognosis: Recovery depends on the severity of the fracture and may require several weeks of rehabilitation.
Longitudinal Fracture
Overview: A longitudinal fracture is a fracture that runs along the length of the bone. It can occur due to stress or trauma.
Symptoms: Pain along the length of the bone, Swelling, Bruising
Causes: Stress fractures, Direct trauma
Diagnosis: X-rays to determine the extent of the fracture, MRI for detailed imaging
Treatment: Immobilization, Pain management, Physical therapy
Prognosis: Healing time varies depending on the location and severity of the fracture.
Oblique Fracture
Overview: An oblique fracture occurs at an angle across the bone, often due to a diagonal force.
Symptoms: Pain, Swelling, Bruising, Deformity of the affected area
Causes: Diagonal or slanted force, Sports injuries, Falls
Diagnosis: X-rays to visualize the fracture, CT scan for detailed imaging
Treatment: Immobilization, Realignment of the bone, Pain management
Prognosis: Healing time varies based on the severity of the fracture.
Pathological Fracture
Overview: A pathological fracture occurs in a bone weakened by disease, such as osteoporosis or cancer.
Symptoms: Pain, Swelling, Deformity
Causes: Underlying bone disease, Cancer, Osteoporosis
Diagnosis: X-rays, MRI or CT scan for detailed imaging, Bone density tests
Treatment: Treatment of the underlying disease, Immobilization, Pain management
Prognosis: Depends on the underlying disease and treatment effectiveness.
Spiral Fracture
Overview: A spiral fracture occurs when a bone is twisted apart, often due to a rotational force.
Symptoms: Severe pain, Swelling, Deformity of the affected area
Causes: Rotational forces, Sports injuries, Accidents
